Ray Tracing with the sightPy Library

I have successfully implemented an example of ray tracing using the sightPy library. Ray tracing is a captivating technique that allows us to generate realistic computer-generated images by simulating how light interacts with objects in a virtual environment. This powerful tool has revolutionized the creation of lifelike images, particularly in animation, visual effects, and video games.

At its core, ray tracing follows a straightforward principle: rays of light are traced from the camera into the scene, and as they intersect with objects, they gather information about materials, lighting, and surroundings. This process enables the calculation of the final color and brightness of each pixel, resulting in stunningly realistic images. To simplify the complexities of ray tracing, I had the privilege of working with the "sightPy" library, a powerful Python tool designed to facilitate the implementation of ray tracing projects. The library provides a collection of classes and functions that handle fundamental ray tracing tasks, including ray generation, intersection testing, and shading computations.

By leveraging the capabilities of "sightPy," I was able to focus more on the creative aspects of ray tracing, leaving the low-level technicalities to the library. For my project, I created a Cornell Box scene from scratch using the sightPy library, and you can find the code for it in the "example.py" file. Additionally another file "example_paraallelism.py" is added that implements parallelism and improves the execution time.

Furthermore, I have also prepared a comprehensive PDF document that explains how to use the sightPy library for coding ray tracing scenes using Python. This document provides step-by-step guidance to assist others in exploring the full potential of the library for their own ray tracing endeavors.
