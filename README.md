Raytracing with sightPy Library

I have implemented an example of ray tracing using sightPy library. Ray tracing is a fascinating technique that enables us to create realistic computer-generated images. Ray tracing simulates the way light interacts with objects in a virtual environment. It's a powerful tool that has revolutionized the way we generate lifelike images, especially in the fields of animation, visual effects, and video games.

At its core, ray tracing follows a straightforward principle: rays of light are traced from the camera into the scene, and as they intersect with objects, they gather information about the materials, lighting, and surroundings. This process allows us to calculate the final color and brightness of each pixel, resulting in stunningly realistic images. To help me tackle the complexities of ray tracing, I had the privilege of working with the "sightpy" library, a powerful Python tool designed to simplify the implementation of ray tracing projects. The library provides a collection of classes and functions that handle fundamental ray tracing tasks, such as ray generation, intersection testing, and shading computations.

By leveraging the capabilities of "sightpy," I was able to focus more on the creative aspects while leaving the low-level technicalities to the library. sightPy library can be found on the following link:
